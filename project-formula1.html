                    <h3><i>Technology Stack</i></h3>
                    <p>Jupyter Notebook, Python, Julia, NumPy, Pandas, MatPlotLib, SciKit-Learn</p>
                    <br>
                    <h3><i>Goal</i></h3>
                    <p>This project was conducted to find a way to predict the future performance of a Formula 1 Driver. There must be a function that can model a driver's performance from which we can observe the rate of improvement or decline in their previous performances and create a prediction of their future improvement by calculating their performance trajectory using linear regression. I uncover the presence of external bias on the model if any.</p>
                    <br>
                    <h3><i>Approach</i></h3>
                    <p>
                        The first step in predicting the performance of a driver is to have their previous championships' standings stored in an accessible and mutable data format. I used Pandas, an open-source data analysis tool, to manipulate the CSVs containing the data and filter out all rows and columns not applicable to the drivers under study. Next, I retrieved all relevant data and stored it in Numpy arrays and used MatPlotLib to visualize the data of the drivers defining the independent variable as the <i>n</i><sup>th</sup> race completed and explanatory variable as the driver's finishing position enumerated from 1 to 20. 
                        <br><br>After charting the data for two drivers on the same plot, there was difficulty in realizing a relationship between the variables. Consequently, I used SKLearn's Linear regression and train-test-split modules to fit the independent variable to the regressor. After the training the model using the CSV data, I charted the predictive test data and recieved a y-intercept value and coefficient value, unique to each driver. 
                        <br><br> The y-intercept represents the expected finishing position of the driver for their 0<sup>th</sup> race. In other words, the y-intercept represented the expected performance of the driver at the beginning of their career. The coefficient for each driver is much more interesting, as this value defines the rate of change of the driver's performance throughout their career. A negative coefficient suggests the driver gets better race by race and reaches a higher finishing position throughout their career, and vice-versa. A numerically large coefficient represents a larger improvement or decline between races. 
                        <br><br> 
                    </p>
                    <p style="text-align:center;">
                        Let <i>p</i> be the expected finishing position at the <i>r</i><sup>th</sup> race.
                    </p>
                    <p>  
                        $$1: p(r) = -0.06664188(r) + 12.02118485$$
                        $$2: p(r) = -0.03019339(r) + 5.79165713$$
                    </p> 

                    <p>
                        <br><br>Now that each driver's predictive model has a y-intercept and coefficient, it's possible to functionally define a line and observe the behaviour of the explanatory variable past the last point of the independent variable. In the specific study I conducted, I noticed that driver one started their career with a mediocre start to their career (high y-intercept) but managed to improve exceedingly well (large negative coefficient). The other driver started their career decently (low y-intercept) but was very slow in long-term improvement (small negative coefficient). However, both drivers are expected to finish 1st place at some point in the future. That's not possible, is it?
                        <br><br>You're right, it's not possible. The fact that both drivers are to be expected in 1<sup>st</sup> place introduces concern for bias. There are credible sources that state driver two was forced to hold back such that driver one can remain consistently in the front. This is the prime example of how my data can predict an outcome but loses credibility when external factors influence the explanatory variable. It is impossible for a mathematical model to be 100% accurate if in the presence of external bias, however, you can approach the 100% as best you can.
